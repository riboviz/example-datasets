Transcript sequences:

Coding sequence locations:

Homo_sapiens_CDS_w_annotated_UTRs.gff3

These files hold Homo sapiens annotations and ORF sequences.

These files were created as follows:

The file containing cDNA sequeces for release 83 (file name Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz; http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-83/fasta/homo_sapiens/cdna/) was downloaded from ENSEMBL FTP site (http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-83/fasta/homo_sapiens/cdna/).

The GFF3 file containing transcript coordinates version 21 (file name gencode.v21.annotation.gff3.gz; http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_21/)  was downloaded from Gencode FTP site (http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_21/)

Isoforms were selected based on the APPRIS database (file name appris_data.principal.txt; https://apprisws.bioinfo.cnio.es/pub/releases/2017_06.v23/datafiles/homo_sapiens/e84v22/appris_data.principal.txt).

Transcript sequences and GFF3 file were generated using rmarkdown/scripts_for_annotation.Rmd

These annotation files were run with Homo_sapiends_rRNA_tRNA.fa contaminants file.

These were run through Riboviz 2.1 tagged main branch, commit: d74847762d9ce8fcdb84387c4f1d98ee41bd6312
