These files were created by Isabel Birds as follows: 

* Drosophila melanogaster GFF was downloaded from Flybase release FB2020_04; ftp://ftp.flybase.net/releases/FB2020_04/dmel_r6.35/gff/dmel-all-r6.35.gff.gz 
* Drosophila melanogaster genome fasta was downloaded from Flybase release FB2020_04; ftp://ftp.flybase.net/releases/FB2020_04/dmel_r6.35/fasta/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.35.fasta.gz 

The transcriptome-centric annotation was prepared using: https://github.com/IsabelBirds/Stuff_to_share/blob/main/Riboviz_work/Converting_fly_genome.Rmd 

* CDS regions in the GFF with no 5'/3'UTR described had a buffer region of flanking_length_nt added (here flanking_length_nt=250 nt, easily updated if needed).
* CDS regions in the GFF with 5'/3'UTRs of length < flanking_length_nt had their buffer region extended. 
* These steps currently ignore intron/exon boundaries.
* Bed files were created using the new ranges, and sequences extracted using bedtools.
* These were combined to create transcriptome-centric GFF and fasta files - Dmel.fasta and Dmel.gff3 (https://github.com/IsabelBirds/Stuff_to_share/tree/main/Riboviz_work/2_Processed_data/Dmel_genomes)

Currently (Jan 2021) Riboviz requires one CDS per gene. 
The transcriptome-centric GFF and fasta files were filtered to meet this requirement using: https://github.com/IsabelBirds/Stuff_to_share/blob/main/Riboviz_work/Filter_fly_genome.Rmd

Dmel_filtered.gff3 was also edited by Flic Anderson to use UTR5/UTR3 instead of five_prime_UTR/three_prime_UTR
