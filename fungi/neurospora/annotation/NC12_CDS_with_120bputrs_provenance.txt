These files were created by Corinne Maufrais, Institut Pasteur, in 2018, to include 120bps of genomic sequence both sides of the CDS.
Beware UTR introns - these are probably not correctly annotated or spliced out.
CDS and genomic data from strain NC12 were downloaded from Ensembl fungi, http://fungi.ensembl.org/Neurospora_crassa/Info/Index
