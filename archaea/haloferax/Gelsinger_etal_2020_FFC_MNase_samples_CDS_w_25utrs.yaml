  reference: Ribosome profiling in archaea reveals leaderless translation, novel translational initiation sites, and ribosome pausing at single codon resolution, Gelsinger et al. 2020
  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa304
  notes: RiboSeq for H. volcanii DS2 strain from Gelsinger et. al. 2020. Successfully run using Python pipeline. Assign A-site using 3'-end mapping strategy. The H.volcanii genome contains a chromosome and 4 plasmids. Due to the circular nature of these plasmids, the origin of replication actually falls somewhere in the middle of gene WP_004050863.1, resulting in some weird behavior when adding this protein to the CDS file. It has been left in for now, but perhaps should be excluded in later analyses.
