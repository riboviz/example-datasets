These files hold DS2 H98 annotations and ORF sequences.

These files were created as follows:

The FASTA file for genome assembly ASM2568v1 (file name GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1_genomic.fna.gz; https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/archaea/Haloferax_volcanii/latest_assembly_versions/GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1/GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1_genomic.fna.gz) was downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/).

The GFF file for genome assembly ASM2568v1 (file name GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1_genomic.gff.gz; https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/archaea/Haloferax_volcanii/latest_assembly_versions/GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1/GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1_genomic.gff.gz) was downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/).

The files GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1_genomic.gff and GCF_000025685.1_ASM2568v1_genomic.fna were extracted from the .gz file.

The H.volcanii DS2 H98 genome contains a chromosome and 4 plasmids. Due to the circular nature of these plasmids, the origin of replication actually falls somewhere in the middle of gene WP_004050863.1, resulting in some weird behavior when adding this protein to the CDS file. It has been left in for now, but perhaps should be excluded in later analyses. 

The sequence and annotation files for the whole approximate E. coli transcriptome were prepared using a modified version of script_for_transcript_annotation.Rmd (https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz/blob/master/rmarkdown/script_for_transcript_annotation.Rmd) that uses a 25 nucleotide buffer for UTRs. 

These annotation files were run with Hvolcanii_DS2_H98_rRNA_tRNA.fasta contaminants file.

These were run through Riboviz 2.0.beta tagged master branch, commit: ffb53643ccfdf78aa64a1627d2dd8a9c092df632
