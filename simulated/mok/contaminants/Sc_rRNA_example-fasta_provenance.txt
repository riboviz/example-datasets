This files was created as follows:

The file genome release R64-1-1 (file name S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203.tgz (https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203.tgz)) was downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (https://www.yeastgenome.org/).
The file rna_coding_R64-1-1_20110203.fasta was extracted from the .tgz file.
